Monitoring data

I would suggest using Grafana (https://grafana.com/) for monitoring since it supports multiple data sources and has data source plugin for Google BigQuery. It can be used to track spend by day (how much you spend on Google Cloud) and get a clear picture of the activity across all projects in the company. Also Grafana serves as debugging tool where you can track unusual activities (when it comes to data or services).
When it comes to analytics and this case, it can be used to see the changes in trends in terms of time or geographic location.
